# Overview

As a software engineer continually expanding my technical skillset, I built an interactive GIS (Geographic Information Systems) web application to strengthen my understanding of mapping technologies, APIs, and real-world data visualization. This project uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to display a dynamic map of Lubbock, Texas, populated with custom markers and information windows.

The application loads the map centered on Lubbock and displays more than 20 points of interest using custom marker icons. Each marker includes an interactive popup that shows details about that location. The data is sourced from publicly available Lubbock datasets, including parks, public buildings, and local landmarks.

My purpose in writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with GIS concepts, API integration, event-driven JavaScript, and user-focused UI interactions such as custom icons and information popups.

# Development Environment

To build the application, I used the following tools:

-Visual Studio Code — Primary editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

-Google Maps JavaScript API — Used to render the map, create markers, load icons, and handle interactions.

-Git / GitHub — Version control and project hosting.

--Live Server extension (VS Code) — For quick local development and auto-refresh.

Programming Languages & Libraries

-HTML5 for UI structure

-CSS3 for layout and map styling

-JavaScript (ES6) for map initialization, marker creation, and event handling

-Google Maps JavaScript API for all GIS functionality
